<!-- ## Some of my Work ##

<details>
  <summary>>> Gothic Untold Chapters</summary>
  Gothic Untold Chapters is the first project I started working on early 2023.
  It's a multiplayer modification and the biggest Roleplay Server for Gothic.
  
  Since I hadn't much experience with the engine they were working with I had a lot of trouble starting out.
  But the more work I did, the better the results.
  My Tasks are:
  - Cleaning and improving the World overall
  - Creating new locations 
  - Changing current buildings to liking of the player

    <summary>>> Innos Church </summary>
      This was basically my first big project, which took a lot of Time.
      I had to not just build onto the mesh but to clean it first - it was a god damn mess.
